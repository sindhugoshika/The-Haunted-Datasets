# The-Haunted-Datasets  

## Overview  
Halloween is on the horizon, so we’ve assembled a spooky collection of haunted locations across the U.S. using the Shadowlands Haunted Places Index. This project invites you to explore geographic and descriptive patterns in these eerie sites—and to sharpen your data cleaning, mapping, and visualization skills along the way.

## Goals  
- Identify states and regions with the highest concentration of reported haunted sites  
- Map spatial distributions and density “hot spots” of haunted locations  
- Analyze textual descriptions to uncover common themes and folklore elements  
- Develop interactive visuals that bring these ghostly stories to life  

# Findings  
- **Regional Clusters:** The Northeast and upper Midwest show the greatest density of reported haunted places.  
- **Urban vs. Rural:** Historic city centers often host more documented sites, while rural “ghost towns” appear as isolated outliers.  
- **Common Themes:** Many descriptions reference 19th-century architecture, Civil War history, and folklore legends.  
- **Spatial Insights:** Coastal and riverfront towns exhibit a higher frequency of hauntings—perhaps linked to early settlement patterns.  

## Technologies Used  
- **R**: Core analysis language  
- **tidyverse** (dplyr, readr, ggplot2): Data wrangling and static visualization  
- **tidytuesdayR**: Loading the Halloween 2023 haunted_places dataset  
- **sf** & **leaflet**: Spatial data handling and interactive mapping  
- **shiny** (optional): Building interactive dashboards  

## Data Source  
All haunted places data were pulled live via the Shadowlands Haunted Places Index and made available on Data World https://query.data.world/s/glc736mqf4dxrqe6nbsamblqndemb6?dws=00000.
